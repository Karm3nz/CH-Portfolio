# CH Responsive Portfolio

## Description 
Hello there!

My name is Carmen Hui. A little bit about myself... I've pet hamster that is in her mid 20s, I love watching whodunnit films, and I am studying web development.

This is my responsive portfolio webpage. The creation of this webpage is to be able to continue to build upon it throughout the up coming weeks and months to not only display the knowledge and skills gained, but to also practice what I have learned thus far. I trust that by the end of the program I will be able to present a more complex, dynamic portfolio page!


A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what your application does, justify the technologies used, and even talk about some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future. 

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? 
Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") 
What problem does it solve? 

What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? 
If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.

If you're new to Markdown, read the GitHub guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

If you need an example of a good README, check out [the VSCode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [License](#license)


## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.


## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

## License

The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.


## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
